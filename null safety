Ex.
int? num1;    # now it can hold Null Value
?         =>>     2- First Check  If the variable was Null,    then ignore what comes after it
Ex.
int? num1;
print (num1?.toDouble());      =>> Output:  null          ,   becuase it fond that num1 was Null so it ignored the ".toDouble()". so it becomes like print(num1); 

void main()
{
  int num2 = 5;
  int num1;
  print(num);      ==> Error

  int? num1;    => u maked it nullable "Can Hold 'Null Value' "



  int num3 = num1  * num2;    =>> Error on the Operator itself "*"

 # Correct

 if (num1 != null){
    int num3 = num1 * num2;          =>> Now its correct because the Operation will not execute untill num1 not equal "Null"
 }
# OR
int num3 = num1! * num2;          =>> u inserted "!"  its like a Gurantee on your self that u don't have "Null" values


int sum = num1;    =>> Error becuase num1 is "Null"

#Correct
int sum = num1 ?? 10;    =>> if num1 is Null, then make   sum = 10
